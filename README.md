This project is made in Lightweight Render Pipeline(LWRP) , after dragging the assets you will see everything pink, so you need to install LWRP from unity package manager on your current project. Don't forget to make a backup before doing this process :)



How to install LWRP:
In unity editor select Windows > Package Manager > select all packages , click advanced and select show preview package and search Lightweight RP then click install , After installation , go to unity editor click edit > Render Pipeline > Universal Render Pipeline > Upgrade project materials to univeral RP materials.
Now right click in project panel and click create > Rendering > Univeral Render Pipeline > Pipeline Render Asset > Pipeline Asset(forward renderer)
Now click edit in unity editor and go to project settings, go to graphics and paste pipeline asset into Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings. If you did each step well then wala :) you're done
